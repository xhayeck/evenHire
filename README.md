## Getting Started
Npm is used to install dependencies, which are stored in node_modules. The Node/Express server connects to a remote database, and the default gulp task starts up the server and watches for file changes. Before running locally, be sure to run:
```
npm install
npm install gulp -g
gulp
```

## Technologies Utilized
This application uses AngularJS for rendering the different views and Node.js, Express, and Postgres for the backend server and database.
